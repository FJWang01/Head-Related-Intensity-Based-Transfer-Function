# Head-Related-Intensity-Based-Transfer-Function

This project measures the intensity vectors in three Cartesian direcions in the vicinity of KEMAR's outer ears. The intensity vectors are measured by MEMS microphone pairs designed by researchers at the Australian National University

KEMAR - Type 45 BA from GRAS Sound & Vibration

Due to the large size, raw impulse responses between the speakers and the microphone pairs can be requested by emailing the author at frank.wang324@gmail.com .
