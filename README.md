# Head-Related-Intensity-Based-Transfer-Function

This project measures the intensity vectors in three Cartesian directions in the vicinity of KEMAR's outer ears. The intensity vectors are measured by MEMS microphone pairs designed by researchers at the Australian National University

## Key Equipment

KEMAR - Type 45 BA from GRAS Sound & Vibration.

MEMS Microphone pair - Two ICS-43432 MEMS microphones spaced 1.5 cm apart.

Loudspeaker - Tannoy system 600 nearfield monitor. 

Single axis rotary table driven by a servo motor. 

## Measurement setup 

The intensity is measured at different body rotation angles. 

In the figure, the KEMAR is facing the loudspeaker and has 0 degrees body rotation angle. The body rotation angle is sampled in 10-degree interval and the rotation direction is shown by the red arrow.
